                   <p> Greetings and welcome to my page. I am a newly developed web-devoloper and I am happy to 
                    begin my path. I hope you find this page useful to explore some of my projects and ideas.
                    Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have been involved with computers from a young age and have wanted to learn more about them from the start. I try to keep my tastes varied and my mind open. I enjoy fun activities ranging from team sports to board games, video games and many things in between. I tend to be a quiet person, but I like to be friendly and outgoing.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hope to sharpen my skills as a web-devoloper and also expand into more technical aspects of the computer world. My goal is to bring people together and to inspire others! </p>
